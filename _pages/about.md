Iâ€™m a PhD Student and Graduate Research Assistant in Computer Science at [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml), Illinois, United States, where I am being advised by [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://zhanglei.phd/). My research focuses on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, **algorithmic reasoning**, **bi-level optimization**, **multimodal learning**, **Large Language Models** while also exploring model architectures.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer, where I focused on full-stack development using technologies like Node.js, React, Next.js, MongoDB. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), Rajshahi, Bangladesh.

I am always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a good chat about tech and research!
